# Hawala 🌙
*Ancient wisdom meets modern cryptography*

## What is this sorcery? 🔮

Hawala is a blockchain-based payment application that brings the centuries-old trust-based hawala system into the digital age. Built on the Ethereum network, it's like your great-grandfather's handshake agreement got a computer science degree and decided to disrupt traditional finance.

## Features 🌟

- **Trust Circles**: Create your own network of trusted partners, just like the original hawala system (but with more cryptography and fewer camels)
- **Instant Transfers**: Move money faster than ancient merchants crossed the Silk Road
- **Smart Contracts**: Traditional honor codes wrapped in military-grade encryption
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Because your money should be as borderless as your ancestors' trade routes
- **Bank Integration**: Bridging the gap between the old world and the new (they still haven't caught up)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy so good, even the ancient money transferors would be impressed

## Installation 🛠️

```bash
# Clone the repo (and several centuries of financial tradition)
git clone https://github.com/omsandippatil/hawala

# Install dependencies (we've come a long way from handshakes)
npm install

# Set up your environment variables (secrets safer than ancient vaults)
cp .env.example .env

# Start the app
npm start
```

## Prerequisites 📋

- Node.js v16+ (Newer than the oldest profession, older than your last crypto investment)
- Ethereum Wallet (MetaMask preferred, but we respect tradition)
- Basic understanding of blockchain (or at least as much as you understand your grandmother's recipes)
- Honor (non-negotiable)

## Configuration ⚙️

1. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```
ETHEREUM_NETWORK=mainnet
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
WALLET_SECRET=your_secret_here_please_dont_share
TRUST_LEVEL=absolute
```

2. Configure your trust circles in `config/trust.js`
3. Reflect on centuries of financial evolution
4. Embrace the future

## Security 🔒

We take security as seriously as a medieval merchant took their word. Our modern approach includes:

- End-to-end encryption
- Validated by network consensus
- Protected by blockchain immutability
- Backed by centuries of trust-based practices
- Guarded by digital algorithms (and tradition)

## Contributing 🤝

Want to contribute? We welcome:
- Bug reports (we call them "trust opportunities")
- Pull requests (vetted like a traditional hawaladar)
- Cultural insights
- Code improvements (must be as reliable as a merchant's handshake)

## License 📄

MIT License (because even ancient systems need modern protection)

## Support 🆘

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check our documentation
2. Consult your trust circle
3. Practice patience (like our ancestors)
4. If all else fails, open an issue

## Disclaimer ⚠️

We are not responsible for:
- Market volatility
- Your trust circle choices
- The existential crisis that comes with modernizing ancient systems
- Your family's reaction when you explain what you do

## Final Words 🌙

Built with ❤️ and centuries of financial wisdom
